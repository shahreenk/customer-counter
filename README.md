# customer-counter

Customized version of the passenger counter project

After doing the guided tutorial of the passenger counter project, I then made a version of my own without following a tutorial.

I once worked in a boutique where I had to keep a running count of the customers that entered the store throughout the day, so this app is for a customer counter rather than a passenger counter.
